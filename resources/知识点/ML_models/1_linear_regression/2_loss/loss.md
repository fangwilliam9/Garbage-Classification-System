# [Loss](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/loss)

[**Loss**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#loss) is a ==numerical metric== that describes how wrong a model's [**predictions**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#prediction) are. 
Loss ==measures== the distance between <u>the model's predictions</u> and <u>the actual labels</u>. 
The goal of training a model is <u>to minimize the loss</u>, reducing it to its lowest possible value.

In the following image, you can visualize loss as arrows drawn from the data points to the model. The arrows show how far the model's predictions are from the actual values.
